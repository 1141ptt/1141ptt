- 👋 Hi, I’m @1141ptt
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, hard for me.😢
- 💞️ I'm too poor in coding, I feel anxious every day,😥 and I seem unable to find a correct for my future.
- 🌺 My GitHub may contain mainly study material and some useful things for myself, 👉as coding is not my talent.😭 
- 📫 Just contact me at GitHub. When I'm not busy, I'll surf GitHub for fun or for learning.
- ⭐ If you like me, please give me a star~ Or set attention on me! Thanks a lot!🌞
